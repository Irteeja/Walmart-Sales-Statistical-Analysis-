# Walmart-Sales-Statistical-Analysis-
This repository provides a comprehensive statistical analysis of Walmart sales data using the powerful Python libraries, Pandas and NumPy.  The main goal of this project is to explore and gain insights from a dataset containing Walmart's sales information.
Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
Descriptive statistics: Calculate summary statistics, such as mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation, to gain a better understanding of the data distribution.
Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Perform data exploration through visualizations, including histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
Time series analysis: Analyze temporal patterns and seasonality in Walmart sales data using methods like moving averages and decomposition.
Hypothesis testing: Conduct statistical tests, such as t-tests and ANOVA, to evaluate the significance of differences between groups or variables.
Regression analysis: Build regression models to predict sales based on relevant features and assess their performance using metrics like R-squared and RMSE.
Advanced analytics: Apply advanced techniques like clustering or classification algorithms to uncover customer segments or predict future sales trends.
This repository serves as a valuable resource for data analysts, data scientists, and anyone interested in exploring and analyzing Walmart's sales data. The well-documented code and examples make it easy to replicate the analysis, customize it to specific needs, and build upon it for further research or business applications.
